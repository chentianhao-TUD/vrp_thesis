notes from the examples.

1) each worker is assigned at most one task:
for worker in range(..):
	model.AddAtMostOne(x[worker, task] for task in range(...)
2) each task is assigned to exactly one worker:
for task in range(...):
	model.AddExactlyOne(x[worker, task] for worker in range(...)
3) the element that needs to be assigned, comes in the for statement

4) group = [
		[0,1,0,1],
		[...],
		...,
	]
   model.AddAllowedAssignments(worker[i], worker[j], ..., group)

own thoughts:
1) obj = []
   input = []
   x_var = []
   input[i, j] * x_var[i, j] then append to obj can work
