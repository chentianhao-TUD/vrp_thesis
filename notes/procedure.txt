1. how to create an arc (an arc is just a tuple of (int, int, BoolVar)) 
    1) Nodes = [...] (create or import Nodes as a list, it will be used a iterable later)
    2) literals = {}
       arcs = []
    3) set NewBoolVar as value in literals, append it in arcs as 3. element
       for i in Nodes:
	   literals[0,i] = model.NewBoolVar(f'0 -> {i}')
	   literals[i,0] = model.NewBoolVar(f'{i} -> 0')
	   arcs.append([0, i, literals[0, i])
	   arcs.append([i, 0, literals[i, 0])
    4) use itertools.permutations to generate all combinations of arcs
    	for i, j in permutations(Nodes, 2)
	    literals[i, j] = model.NewBoolVar(f'{i} -> {j}')
	    arcs.append([i, j, literals[i, j]])
    5) model.AddCircuit(arcs)

2. how to iterate in cp_model
	1) list: Nodes, Vehicles
	   dict: x_var
	2) for k in Vehicles:
		for i in Nodes:
			model.AddExactlyOne(x[(k, i, j)] for j in Nodes)
	3) this create a constraint: every Node j must be visited once, dosent matter by which k and from which Node
